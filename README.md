# HackerRankPython

* Author: Anthony Nassar, anthonyabunassar@gmail.com

This repository contains Python implementations of "interview questions" from https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/interview-preparation-kit. Since people are always posting their complete solutions to the "discussions," and these problems
are merely for practice anyway, I saw no reason to keep this repository private.

Files are organized asd on the HackerRank site. Problems from the "Interview Preparation Kit" are under `./interview-preparation`.
Everything else is under `./problem-solving`: problems from https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures are under `./problem-solving/data-structures` and problems from https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms are under `./problem-solving/algorithms`.
